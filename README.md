# D.E.V.A
Data Encryption and Verification Application

#### It is basically a data  encryption program, I have developed a method for encryption which encrypt the data, this project have a encrypter and decrypter, with this we can encrypt the file and only can be decrypted with the decrypter, There are two modes to encrypt one is "Only this system" and other is "Any system". With the "Only this system" the data will be encrypted so that it will be opened only in current system, If we used "Any system" the data will be encrypted so that it can be decrypted in any system. The program will store the decrypted file in the same fodler where the decrypter is stored. The copy of decrypted file is stroed and encrypted file is persisted but it can not be decrypted again using the decrypter

## Notable Features
- It has standaloe encrypter
- It has stadalone decrypter
- It provides two modes of encryption

- [x] Built with the end-user in mind, DEVA offers two unique encryption modes: "Only this system" and "Any system". With "Only this system", your data is encrypted to be accessible only on your current system. 🏡💼 The "Any system" mode, as the name implies, allows your encrypted data to be decrypted on any system. 🌐💻

- [x] One of the key features of DEVA is its ability to store a copy of the decrypted file in the same folder where the decrypter is stored. And here's the kicker - the encrypted file remains, but it cannot be decrypted again using the decrypter. It's security at its finest! 🔒✨

- [x] Currently, DEVA excels at decrypting text-based files, but don't worry, I'm diligently working on expanding its capabilities to cater to different types of files. Stay tuned for more updates! 🚀📁

- 🤗I am inviting each one of you to take a spin on DEVA and share your invaluable feedback. Your insights can help make DEVA even better!
